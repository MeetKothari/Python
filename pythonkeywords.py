# An interesting script I found on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org that displays all of the Python keywords.
# I didn't even know something like this existed. You learn something new everyday!

import keyword # this is a module used to determine if a string is a keyword or soft keyword.
 
# printing all keywords at once using "kwlist()"
print("\nThe list of keywords is: ")
print (keyword.kwlist)
